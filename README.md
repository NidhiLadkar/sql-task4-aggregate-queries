# Task 4 - Aggregate Functions and Grouping 

# Objective
To use SQL aggregate functions to summarize and analyze tabular data using `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.



# Key Concepts
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data (e.g., total revenue, average price)
- **Grouping**: Categorizing data (e.g., by customer, product)
- **Filtering Groups**: Using `HAVING` to apply conditions after grouping



# Features Demonstrated
- Total number of customers
- Average price of products
- Total revenue per payment method
- Orders grouped by customer
- Products filtered by order quantity



# Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- Schema: `ecommerce_db`



# Files Included
- `task4_aggregate_queries.sql`: Contains all SQL aggregation and grouping queries.
